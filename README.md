# fakeSMTP
Socket Application in PHP to emulate a SMTP server

It enables to use email sending capabilities of (mostly) older hardware that cannot use webservice, sftp or anything else. If you do not plan to setup or administrate a real SMTP service, or if you do just want to trigger some simple tasks (for example publishing to MQTT), the fakeSMTP might become handy.
